# Patchlings — Brand & Visual Identity

Patchlings is a developer tool that makes agentic coding observable, teachable, and human.
The mascot is not decoration — it represents a **unit of work**.

## Core Concept
A Patchling is a small worker that carries a “patch” from intent to implementation.

Visually, every Patchling expresses a dual nature:
- **Left side (Fabric):** human intent, creativity, iteration
- **Right side (Circuit):** machine execution, determinism, automation
- **Seam:** stitching represents integration, not replacement
- **Expression:** calm, helpful, never chaotic
- **Object:** a `</>` code block — the atomic unit of work

Patchlings do not generate chaos.
They **carry**, **apply**, and **complete** patches.

## Canonical Logo (Patchling Core)
The canonical Patchlings logo is referred to internally as **`patchling-core`**.

It is a single Patchling:
- Rounded silhouette
- Two-state split (fabric ↔ circuit)
- Stitched smiling mouth
- Large, friendly eyes
- Holding a `</>` code block

Use this for:
- GitHub avatar
- README header
- Website / landing page
- App icon / favicon
- CLI splash

## Role Variants (skins, not new mascots)

### Patchling: Builder
Represents active implementation (writes/patches/builds).
- Same body + code block
- Extra “sparks” above head

### Patchling: Learner
Represents teaching mode (Learn-lings overlay).
- Same body + code block
- Small `?` marker on block face

### Patchling: Narrator
Represents Story Time (chapter export).
- Same body + code block
- Small book marker on block face

## Color Philosophy
Colors may vary by theme/role, but the structure never changes.
Never remove:
- the seam
- the smile
- the code block

---

## What NOT to do
- Don’t imitate other developer mascots
- Don’t redesign the silhouette
- Don’t add aggressive/chaotic features
- Don’t show secrets in UI assets
