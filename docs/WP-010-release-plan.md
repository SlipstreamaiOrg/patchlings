# WP-010 — Release Plan (Semver + Changelog + v0.1 Exit)

## Goal
Document the Patchlings release plan: semver policy, changelog strategy, and v0.1 exit criteria.

## Scope (In)
- Add/extend docs that define semver policy and changelog strategy.
- Document release steps and v0.1 exit criteria.

## Scope (Out)
- Release automation or CI changes.

## Constraints
- Privacy-first documentation.
- No runtime behavior changes.

## Plan
1. Add a release plan doc (or update ROADMAP) with semver + changelog policy.
2. Define v0.1 exit criteria.
3. Cross-link from ROADMAP if needed.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Semver policy documented (including telemetry contract implications).
- Changelog strategy documented.
- Release steps documented (version bump, tag, release notes).
- v0.1 exit criteria explicit.
