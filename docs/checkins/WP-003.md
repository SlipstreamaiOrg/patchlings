# WP-003 Check-ins — PixiJS Universe Viewer + Colony Simulation

## Preflight
- WP issue: #11
- Branch: `wp/003-pixi-universe-viewer`
- Commands to validate:
  - `npx pnpm@9.12.0 install`
  - `npx pnpm@9.12.0 typecheck`
  - `npx pnpm@9.12.0 test`
  - `npx pnpm@9.12.0 demo`

## Milestones
- [x] Runner asset route + sanity check
- [x] PixiJS dependency + base renderer
- [x] Colony simulation + jobs
- [x] Telemetry wiring + hotspot + cues
- [x] Docs updated + demo validated

## Notes
- Keep scope tight; prefer reliable placeholders over ambitious art.
- `/assets` conflicted with Vite build assets; the runner route is now `/patchlings-assets`.
- Runner snapshots now include recent events so Learn-lings works even after short demo runs finish.
- Validation (January 27, 2026): typecheck, test, and build all pass. Demo behavior was verified via Playwright screenshots and a stream probe.
