# Roadmap

This roadmap is intentionally biased toward correctness, privacy, and determinism before visual flash.

## v0.1 Foundation (Current Focus)

- [x] Telemetry Protocol v1 (schema + types + validation)
- [x] Redaction and salted hashing by default
- [x] Persistent world state plus chaptering
- [x] Demo adapter and Codex JSONL adapter
- [x] Runner bridge plus WS stream
- [x] Viewer MVP (Universe + timeline + toggles + export)
- [x] Learn-lings overlay (metadata-only)
- [x] Story Time exporter (deterministic Markdown)

## Next

- Universe theme polish and richer Patchling behaviors
- Stronger backpressure summaries and UI telemetry health indicators
- Adapter plugin API and external agent examples
- Recording browser and deterministic replay tooling
- Theme pack publishing guide and theme registry
- Release process (see docs/RELEASE.md)
