# WP-006 — Protocol v1 Breaking-Change Callout

## Goal
Document the rule that breaking changes to Telemetry v1 must bump the version and include a migration note.

## Scope (In)
- Documentation updates (protocol + architecture) clarifying versioning/migrations.

## Scope (Out)
- Schema or runtime changes.

## Constraints
- Keep the telemetry contract stable.
- No behavior changes.

## Plan
1. Add explicit breaking-change/version bump callout in docs.
2. Validate documentation accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria
- Docs clearly state: breaking changes require a version bump and migration note.
- No runtime behavior changes.
