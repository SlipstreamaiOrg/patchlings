# Patchlings — Brand & Visual Identity

Patchlings is a developer tool that makes agentic coding observable, teachable, and human.
The mascot is not decoration — it represents a **unit of work**.

## Core Concept
A Patchling is a small worker that carries a “patch” from intent to implementation.

Visually, every Patchling expresses a dual nature:
- **Left side (Fabric):** human intent, creativity, iteration
- **Right side (Circuit):** machine execution, determinism, automation
- **Seam:** stitching represents integration, not replacement
- **Expression:** calm, helpful, never chaotic
- **Object:** a `</>` code block — the atomic unit of work

Patchlings do not “generate” chaos.
They **carry**, **apply**, and **complete** patches.

## Canonical Logo (Patchling Core)

The canonical Patchlings logo is a **single Patchling**:
- Rounded silhouette
- Vertical two-state split (fabric ↔ circuit)
- Stitched smiling mouth
- Large, friendly eyes
- Holding a yellow `</>` code block

This logo is referred to internally as **`patchling-core`**.

This asset is used for:
- GitHub avatar
- README header
- Website / landing page
- App icon / favicon
- CLI splash

## Color Philosophy
- Colors may vary **by role or theme**, but the structure never changes.
- Fabric side uses softer, warmer textures.
- Circuit side uses saturated, luminous colors with trace lines.
- Stitching is always visible and warm-toned.

Never remove:
- the seam
- the smile
- the block

---

## What NOT to do
- Do not add limbs, faces, or features that imply chaos or aggression
- Do not anthropomorphize beyond subtle emotion
- Do not imitate other developer mascots (Octocat, Docker whale, etc.)
- Do not redesign the silhouette — variations happen *within* the shape

---

## Patchlings Are Canonical
Patchlings are not a theme.
They are the **physical manifestation of work** inside the system.

If a visualization exists, Patchlings exist inside it.
If work is happening, a Patchling is carrying something.
